1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,920
Hmm, listen to that fire crackling, my
dear.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,040
Nights like this always take me back.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,400
Back to a time long before you were born.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,400
A time when life moved softer and the
world felt

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,000
quieter.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,900
Yes, the 1960s.

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,860
When I was a young boy, life was simple
but full

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,760
of magic. No screens, no

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,700
buzzing phones. Just the open sky and a
heart that believed

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,120
anything could happen.

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,160
I remember summer evenings like this. My
friends and I racing

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,120
bicycles down dusty roads, chasing the
wind. The sunset glowing

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,140
warm gold and red, like this fire on your
cheeks.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,120
And at night, we'd sit around a little
fire, just like we are now.

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,540
The grown-ups whispered about the world
changing,

16
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,500
music louder, dreams bigger, hope

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,180
growing in new ways.

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,420
I still remember hearing, let it be, on a
neighbor's radio.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,980
Even now, it feels like warm bread to my
soul.

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,380
Comforting, familiar, safe.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,820
Back then, my biggest worry was if my kite
would fly tomorrow.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,280
And my greatest treasure was a tin box of
pebbles, little notes,

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,600
and one silver button from the market.

24
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,600
Funny how small things felt huge. But the

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,380
memories closest to my heart are nights
like this.

26
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,880
When my own grandfather sat with me by a
fire.

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,760
Telling stories of his youth as sparks
drifted into the dark sky.

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,400
So tonight, my dear, as this fire crackles
softly

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,200
and the night wraps around us like a
blanket.

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,740
I want you to remember this moment, its
warmth,

31
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,960
its quiet.

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,000
My voice sharing a piece of the 1960s.

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,920
Because someday, years from now, you might
sit by your

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,700
own fire with a little one.

35
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,040
Telling them about a quiet evening back in
the 2020s,

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,580
when your old grandpa shared his heart.

37
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,320
Now close your eyes, sweetheart.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,280
Let the fires whisper and grandpa's
memories carry

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,060
you to sleep.

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,200
Good night.

41
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,580
Good night, my dear.

42
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,720
Good night.
